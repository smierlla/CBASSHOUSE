The changes that I incorporated in phase 2 of the project was a javascript alert message on the heading of my html that way when users are trying to look at my page they will
be alerted of the new devices that are out . as well as to leave all the questions in my Q&A page. the website that I build basicaly helps  people who are new to the 
smarthphone industry  as well as those people who just want to get the most out of their cell phone devices. the reason I did this website , was beucause I feel that it will help 
maximize the productivity and helfuness that we offer to our customers at my job ( T-Mobile).

*In phase 3 of the projects I addeed new pictures to my page and fixed my html code so that it was in stadard with the validator. 
I also made sure that all of the java script code worked accordingly.

*In phase 4 of my website a I added Jquery to my "questions and answers page" so when a user fill out the fields some of them will outo complete and  it will also
 provided them with a datepicker aplication.

* All of the website videos will be eventually replaced with my own creations and i am also planing to add php
 and Mysql later on in my career at uncc.
